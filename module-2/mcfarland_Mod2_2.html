    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Holly McFarland.  I live and grew up in Statesville, NC.  Statesville was a small town growing up, but has 
        grown to have a population of over 24,000.
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence">I have a son who is 15 years old.  I enjoy spending time with him and especially watching and talking about football together.
        Though we both have different teams that we cheer for (the Bills for him and Panthers for me), we both desire to watch a good football game.</span>
    </p>
    <p>I am currently working on my Software Development degree.  Previously, I attained an Associate Degree in Information Technology-Software Development.
        I am enjoying learning more about programming and going into depth about how to be successful.
